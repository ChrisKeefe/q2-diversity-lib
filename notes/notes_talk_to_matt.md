Patch and Mock:
What is the patch parameter actually being used for, if it fails to behave as expected unless I re-assign? 
Maybe it just introduces e.g. the mocked Process.cpu_affinity into the namespace, without making it accessible through that variable?



Tags:
Is the position of the most-recent tag important (e.g. at the HEAD of master?)?
Are we using annotated tags or lightweight tags? I suspect annotated. Does this matter?
